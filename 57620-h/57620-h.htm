<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">&ldquo;Watch Wichita Win&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Watch Wichita Win&rdquo; is the city motto that has been adopted by
Wichita and there is every proof that the community is justifying it.
In 1900 Wichita had a population of 25,000; today its population exceeds
63,000, and there are good grounds to believe it will soon be a city of 100,000.</p>
<p>The location of Wichita was not an accident. Long before the white man came
the Indians chose the junction of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas Rivers as a
meeting place from which to conduct their campaigns and hunting expeditions into
the Southwest territory. Before the railways reached Wichita, it was a center for
the cattle trade of Oklahoma and Texas. In 1872 the first railway train entered
Wichita over the Wichita Southwestern, a branch of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa
Fe, and the city became at once a distributing point for the Southwestern country.</p>
<p>Today Wichita is served by six trunk lines, reaching into Western Kansas,
Eastern Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, and Mexico.</p>
<p>The development of Wichita in the last ten years has been many-sided. Perhaps
its most important growth has been in the live stock and grain markets. In 1912,
14,465 cars of grain came to the Wichita market and 10,759 cars of live stock were
received at the Wichita Union Stockyards. Wichita is the largest broom corn market
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
in the United States, parts of Oklahoma and Western Kansas being peculiarly
adapted for the growth of broom corn. The city&rsquo;s standing as a distributing center
is evidenced by its large number of jobbing houses, with business covering Southern
Kansas, Oklahoma and parts of Texas and New Mexico. There are more than a hundred
jobbing houses located here. Among these, ten firms deal in agricultural implements,
six wholesale grocery firms, three dry goods jobbers, three wholesale drug
houses.</p>
<p>Surrounding Wichita is one of the great wheat districts of the world and this fact,
with the city&rsquo;s superior transportation facilities, is largely responsible for the milling
industry. The city&rsquo;s flouring mills have a capacity of 7,000 barrels a day and their
product is shipped to California and to New York, to Oregon and to European
ports. This branch of Wichita&rsquo;s manufacturing and commercial industry is growing
steadily. Eight hundred men are employed in sash and door factories. In foundries
250 men are employed.</p>
<p>The faith of Wichita&rsquo;s builders is shown in its wide streets. In the residence district
a large portion of the street has been converted into parking and at many points
branches of the trees meet in the middle, forming arches.</p>
<p>In public improvements the city is remarkably progressive. It has eleven parks
with an area of 416 acres, and a public gathering place, known as the Forum, with a
seating capacity of 5,500. In 1911 it ranked eighth among all cities in the United
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
States in the area of new paving. Its office buildings&mdash;among them 10-story structures&mdash;are
built on most modern lines; building permits in one year reached seven
and one-half million dollars.</p>
<p>The water supply of Wichita comes from cylinders sunk forty feet beneath the
bed of the Big Arkansas river. The water flows through a deep body of gravel before
entering the cylinders, providing a supply of unusual purity. Air pumps syphon
the water from the cylinders to cement reservoirs, where it is aerated before passing
into the city mains.</p>
<p>The educational facilities of Wichita are complete. A new high school, the
building costing $200,000, is at the head of the public school system. Friends University,
Fairmount College and Mt. Carmel Academy cover the field of higher education.
The main building of Friends University cost $265,000.</p>
<p>In its physical appearance, in the class of retail and wholesale business buildings
and public structures, such as the city hall, government building and schools,
Wichita gives the impression of a city twice the population. The completion of the
New Union Passenger Terminal Station, with the elevation of railway tracks, adds
greatly to this feeling. This terminal work cost two and one-half million dollars and
was completed early in 1914.</p>
<p>In this book are illustrations of the new Passenger Terminal, of the business and
residence sections of the city and of some of the more important public buildings&mdash;the
whole a true picture of one of the most aggressive cities in all the Southwest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h3 id="c2">The Wichita Union Terminal Station</h3>
<p>The Wichita Union Terminal Station, opened in 1914, is
used by the Santa Fe, the Frisco, the Rock Island, and
the Orient lines. The building, 600 feet in length, has a
frontage of 103 feet on Douglass Avenue, Wichita&rsquo;s main thoroughfare.
It is constructed of concrete, Colorado limestone and
terra cotta, and is fireproof throughout. Trains enter by means of
elevated tracks, connected with the waiting rooms by inclined
planes.</p>
<p>Including the approaches and track elevations, the station cost
approximately two and one-half million dollars.</p>

<h3 id="c3">The Concourse and Ticket Offices of the Wichita Union Terminal Station</h3>
<p>The main concourse of Wichita&rsquo;s new Union Terminal
Station is 100 feet long and 55 feet wide. The floors are
of marble, the walls of glazed terra cotta, and it is aglow
with natural light. The station building, constructed of concrete,
limestone and terra cotta, is fireproof and cost, including approaches,
approximately two and one-half million dollars.</p>

<h3 id="c4">Main Waiting Room, Wichita Union Terminal Station</h3>
<p>The main waiting room of Wichita&rsquo;s new Union Terminal
Station is 165 feet long, 125 feet wide and 25 feet high,
and is open to sunlight on three sides, making it unusually
cheerful and attractive. The floors are of marble; glazed terra
cotta is used on the walls. Inclined planes lead to the elevated
tracks over which all passenger trains run.</p>
<p>Wichita is among the most important railroad centers in the
Southwest, and has large live stock packing and jobbing interests,
while some of its manufactured products are sent to all the civilized
world.</p>

<h3 id="c5">Dining Room of the Wichita Terminal Station</h3>
<p>The dining room in the new Union Terminal Station in
Wichita immediately adjoins the main waiting room and
concourse. Across the hall are the men&rsquo;s smoking room,
telegraph offices and parcel rooms. One end of the dining room is
occupied by the lunch counter, while the other end is given over to
tables. The floors and walls are finished in terra cotta, glazed tile
or marble.</p>
<p>About a hundred persons may be served at a sitting. The management
is under the direction of Fred Harvey.</p>
<p>Wichita is one of the most important commercial centers of the
Southwest. Its wholesale interests and packing and live stock industries
are growing steadily. The new Union Station with terminals
cost approximately two and one-half million dollars and
was completed in 1913.</p>

<h3 id="c6">Concourse, Wichita Union Terminal Station</h3>
<p>Opposite the main waiting room of the Union Terminal
Station, Wichita is the concourse which leads to the train
platforms. Here are the news and fruit stand and the
soda fountain, all constructed of marble or white terra cotta tile,
as is the main portion of the Concourse. A side sky-light gives the
Concourse sunshine most of the day.</p>

<h3 id="c7">Ladies&rsquo; Retiring Room, Wichita Union Terminal Station</h3>
<p>Adjoining the Main Waiting room of the Wichita
Union Terminal Passenger Station is the Ladies&rsquo; Retiring
Room. Here are provided all the comforts and conveniences
required by women and children on a journey. A ladies&rsquo;
maid is at the service of the traveler, and there are wash and toilet
rooms, easy chairs and couches where one may recline. It is decorated
in cheerful tones and is a good example of the consideration
that has come to be expected by the traveling public in these days.</p>

<h3 id="c8">A Twilight View of the New Union Terminal Station, Wichita, Kansas</h3>
<p>Wichita&rsquo;s new Union Terminal Station, constructed
of Colorado limestone and concrete, with terra cotta
facing, is architecturally on strong, dignified lines, with
the pleasing gracefulness of the Renaissance. The main building
fronts a plaza on Douglass Avenue, the city&rsquo;s main thoroughfare,
giving the traveler an attractive entrance to the heart of the city.
The interior is of concrete, tile and marble. It is fireproof throughout.</p>

<h3 id="c9">&ldquo;Watch Wichita Win&rdquo;&mdash;The Motto of an Aggressive Community</h3>
<p>Spanning the intersection of two of the principal streets
in the retail section of Wichita is the motto that best expresses
the spirit of the community&mdash;&ldquo;Watch Wichita
Win.&rdquo; At night this motto stands out, brilliant in lights, where it
may be seen from the trains entering and leaving the city. And
that Wichita is living up to its watchword is proved by its record
of growth in population. In 1890 it had 15,620 inhabitants; in
1895, 20,839; in 1900, 24,691; in 1905, 34,520, and today it has
reached the 65,000 mark. &ldquo;Wichita Is Winning.&rdquo; The large building
in the illustration is the Hotel Eaton.</p>

<h3 id="c10">Looking North on Main Street, Wichita</h3>
<p>In its business and office buildings Wichita surpasses any city
in Kansas. In the illustrations are shown some of the more
important commercial structures of Wichita, among them
the Beacon building, ten stories; the Boston department store and
the Schweiter building, ten stories. The founders of Wichita, with
foresight based on their faith in the city&rsquo;s greatness, made the
streets wide and their wisdom is appreciated by the men who are
building the city today.</p>

<h3 id="c11">The Live Stock Exchange, Wichita</h3>
<p>Wichita&rsquo;s real development as a live stock market has
come within the last seven or eight years and since then
its progress has been truly remarkable. In three years,
1906 to 1909, the cattle receipts increased 400 per cent and hog
receipts 150 per cent. In order to keep pace with this growth the
Union Stock Yards Company has been forced to add acres of pens
to its equipments almost every year. The pens are brick-paved
and each contains watering and feeding troughs. The exchange
building, erected by the Stock Yards Company, contains a national
bank, the offices of commission firms, of the stock yards company,
of the Terminal Railroad and branch offices of the packing companies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h3 id="c12">Union Stock Yards, Wichita</h3>
<p>Wichita has two large packing houses with a capacity
of 6,000 animals a day. The annual receipts at the
Union Stock Yards reach one million a year. Wichita
is looked upon as a logical point for a packing house and stockyards
center, first, because it is located at the very entrance of the
great Southwestern cattle district, and, secondly, because it has the
transportation lines reaching into the great stock-growing country.
Twelve hundred men are employed in the packing houses and about
500 in the stockyards. It is estimated that 4,000 persons are dependent
upon this branch of Wichita&rsquo;s commercial activity.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h3 id="c13">Wichita as a Milling Center</h3>
<p>Kansas has soil and climate peculiarly adapted to the growing
of Red Turkey Hard Wheat. An area of more than 8
million acres is devoted to the raising of Red Turkey
Wheat in Kansas and there are perhaps four million acres more
suitable for the purpose and now given over to grazing. From
Wichita railway lines spread like spokes from a hub into these wheat
fields. The milling capacity of Wichita is now 7,000 barrels daily;
millers say it should have 10,000 barrels output, with a possibility of
20,000 within a few years. The illustration shows one of the modern
flouring plants in Wichita.</p>

<h3 id="c14">In the Retail Business District, Wichita</h3>
<p>With its 10-story buildings and extensive retail establishments,
Wichita&rsquo;s business district suggests a city of
twice its size. This development is largely due to the
wide commercial influence of Wichita, shoppers coming from all
the surrounding territory. The retail stores of Wichita are of
unusual attractiveness, both in equipment as well as stock.</p>

<h3 id="c15">The Forum, A Gathering Place for the People of Wichita</h3>
<p>The city of Wichita built a structure 260 feet long and 160
feet wide as a meeting place for the people of the city and
surrounding territory. It is designed so that it may be
used for a horse show or a concert, for a political convention or a
lecture. Steel, brick and cement were used in its construction at
a cost of $170,000 and it has a seating capacity of 5,500. This
capacity can be enlarged about 1,000 when seats are placed on the
stage.</p>

<h3 id="c16">Y. M. C. A. Building, Wichita</h3>
<p>The home of the Y. M. C. A., Wichita, was built in 1907
at a cost of $110,000. With three stories and basement it
contains forty-five sleeping rooms and suites. The auditorium
seats 700 and the gymnasium, 42 by 78 feet, contains a 32-lap
running track. In addition to the usual tub and shower baths,
the building has a swimming pool, 60 by 20 feet, lined with tile and
graduating in depth from three to eight feet. The roof is designed
so that it may be used as a roof garden on warm evenings. The
first meeting to organize a Y. M. C. A. in Wichita was held in 1885.
The money for the present building was subscribed in a three weeks&rsquo;
campaign.</p>
<p>In 1913 the Y. W. C. A. of Wichita acquired a home costing
$100,000, the funds coming from public subscriptions.</p>

<h3 id="c17">The High School, Wichita</h3>
<p>When Wichita opened its first High School, in 1868,
there were eight pupils and one teacher. One room
afforded the necessary space. The Wichita High School
of today gives by contrast some impression of the growth of the
city. Now about 40 teachers are employed in training 800 pupils.</p>
<p>The building cost $200,000 and has fifty rooms. Manual training
and domestic science are included in the courses of study.
Credits from the Wichita High School are accepted by the leading
colleges and universities, both for men and women, throughout the
country.</p>

<h3 id="c18">A Public School Building, Wichita</h3>
<p>The public school system of Wichita is the largest business
enterprise in the city, and is growing so steadily that new
buildings are almost constantly under way. In design
and construction the buildings are on the latest lines of school architecture,
with every provision for the health and comfort of the pupils.
The city has more than two million dollars invested in school
property. Approximately 10,000 pupils are enrolled in the city&rsquo;s
schools.</p>

<h3 id="c19">Boat House, Arkansas River, Wichita</h3>
<p>The idea of boating is not usually associated with a Kansas
community, but this form of recreation is a popular one
in Wichita and that under most pleasant conditions.
Through a large portion of the year the Arkansas river at Wichita
offers good rowing and in the evenings is alive with boating parties.
The illustration shows a boat house located on the banks of the
stream with the foliage of a public park forming a background.</p>

<h3 id="c20">The Wichita Club, Wichita</h3>
<p>The clubhouse of the Wichita Club is a five-story and basement
structure erected by the organization as its home in
1910. It occupies a space 150&times;140 and cost $100,000.
On the first floor are the ladies&rsquo; reception room, dining room, lounge,
living room and offices. The second floor is given over to dining
rooms and kitchen. On the third floor are billiard and meeting
rooms. The fourth and fifth floors are given over to sleeping apartments.
The Wichita Club had its origin in the old Coronado
Club in 1897. It is one of the great factors in the development of
the community, both commercially and socially.</p>

<h3 id="c21">Glimpse of a Public Park, Wichita</h3>
<p>The commission form of government has been adopted by
Wichita, and one of the five commissioners is in charge of
parks and public works. The park system is composed of
nine parks, with shaded lawns, drives and winding streams. Riverside
Park is the largest, with an area of 140 acres, and contains a
zoological collection with buffalo, lions, deer, ostriches and other
specimens.</p>

<h3 id="c22">A Bridge Spanning the Arkansas River, Wichita</h3>
<p>In the construction of its public works and buildings Wichita
has placed permanence first. A good example of this policy
may be found in the reinforced concrete bridge crossing the
Arkansas River, of great beauty in design, it is built to withstand
the ages. The main roadway is 40 feet wide with two 8-foot walks.
The seven spans have a total length of 550 feet.</p>

<h3 id="c23">A Residence Street, Wichita</h3>
<p>It has been said of Wichita that its homes make it a city of
genuine contentment. Its people are, as a rule, homeowners.
The illustration is one of the newer residence
streets and shows the simple graceful lines now most in vogue in
the domestic architecture of the city. In some of the older residence
sections, where the trees have had time for growth, the streets are
arched by foliage&mdash;a cause of general comment from visitors who
think of Kansas as a treeless prairie land.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h3 id="c24">The City Hall, Wichita</h3>
<p>Almost twenty-five years ago the people of Wichita
showed their confidence in the certain growth of their
city by the building of a City Hall that would be a credit
to any city of 200,000 population. Architecturally it is one of the
most impressive structures in the city, and its size insures ample
space for years to come. Until a few years ago the city government
was conducted on the old plan of mayor, councilmen and
other elective officials. Now a mayor commissioner and four other
commissioners constitute the city government.</p>

<h3 id="c25">Postoffice and Federal Building, Wichita</h3>
<p>More than 200 persons are employed in the Wichita postoffice,
including the railway mail clerks who have their
headquarters here. In ten years the receipts of the
Wichita postoffice have more than doubled. The entire third floor
of the building is equipped for the use of the United States courts,
which convene here twice a year. An addition was built two years
ago.</p>

<h3 id="c26">Scottish Rite Masonic Temple, Wichita</h3>
<p>The first lodge of Masons was established in Wichita in
1870 and the first Scottish Rite body was instituted in
1887. The order now has about 3,000 members and occupies
what is, perhaps, the finest Scottish Rite Temple in the United
States. The structure is of solid stone, four stories in height and
occupies one of the most important corners in the city. It is owned
and occupied solely by the Scottish Rite Masons of Wichita.</p>

<h3 id="c27">The New Travelers&rsquo; Hotel, Wichita</h3>
<p>With the good hotel facilities now possessed by Wichita,
a new structure, to be known as the Travelers, is under
way. It will be six stories, fireproof, of steel, terra
cotta, concrete and brick. The site covers a space 125 by 140 feet
in the business section. Travelers&rsquo; Hotel is to cost $500,000.00 and
will have 200 rooms. It was financed by residents of Wichita.</p>

<h3 id="c28">Kansas Masonic Home and Chapel, Wichita</h3>
<p>Set in fifteen acres of beautiful lawn and woodland is the
Kansas Masonic Home, Wichita. It is built of gray stone
and was established by the Grand Lodge of Kansas in 1896.
The stone chapel was built by the Order of the Eastern Star, and
most of the furniture for the home was supplied by this order.
Aged Master Masons, their wives or widows and children and
members of the Eastern Star are eligible to the benefits of the
home. The home is maintained by a per capita tax on the members
of the Kansas Grand Lodge of Masons and of the Order of the
Eastern Star.</p>

<h3 id="c29">The Central Station Company, Wichita Fire Department</h3>
<p>Five station houses comprise the Wichita Fire Department,
all connected by a signal system with the central
station. The efficiency of Wichita&rsquo;s fire protection is best
shown by the fact that the city has never suffered what might be
termed a disastrous fire loss. Under the commission form of government
the mayor has supervision of police and fire departments
and the prevailing policy is to supplant gradually the horse drawn
fire apparatus with motor vehicles.</p>

<h3 id="c31">Mount Carmel Academy, Wichita</h3>
<p>In institutions for higher education Wichita is unusually well
equipped, having several co-educational colleges and it is
also the seat of Mt. Carmel Academy, a high grade school
for young ladies. In addition to the usual academic courses, departments
of music, art and elocution are maintained. Students are
drawn from Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Texas. The
academy was opened in 1887 by five Sisters of Charity. Additions
were built in 1900 and again in 1906. The buildings are heated
with hot water and every room is so situated as to receive sunshine.</p>

<h3 id="c32">Friends&rsquo; University and Fairmount College, Wichita</h3>
<p>It was in 1898 that the Friends&rsquo; church of Kansas established
Friends&rsquo; University in Wichita and now Friends&rsquo; academies
throughout the Southwest send young men and women
to the university. The main building, shown in the lower corner,
was the gift of James M. Davis, a St. Louis manufacturer.</p>
<p>Fairmount College is a Congregational institution that has
reached a firm foundation after years of struggle. Opened as an
academy in 1892 it has progressed steadily until it has an enrollment
exceeding 300 pupils. In addition to the main building,
shown here, Fairmount has a library of 35,000 volumes, a gymnasium
and a men&rsquo;s dormitory.</p>
<p>St. John&rsquo;s School for boys, a Catholic institution, is located in
Wichita.</p>

structures of Wichita. In the upper left corner is the
First Presbyterian; opposite, the Roman Catholic Cathedral.
In the lower left corner is St. Paul&rsquo;s Methodist Episcopal
Church, and opposite the First Baptist Church. Wichita has been

away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
